# Liver-Tumor-Segmentation-from-CT-Images-using-ResUNet

Liver tumor segmentation done by applying the segmentation algorithm twice. First to segment the liver and second to segment the tumor from the segmented liver to improve the accuracy of the segmented results.

The dataset used in this literature is obtained from [Liver segmentation 3D-IRCADb-01](https://www.ircad.fr/research/data-sets/liver-segmentation-3d-ircadb-01/)
